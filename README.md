> We present a novel generative model for
Computer Aided Design (CAD) that 1) represents high-level design concepts of a CAD model as a
three-level hierarchical tree of neural codes, from global part arrangement down to local curve geometry; and 2) controls the generation of CAD models by specifying the target design using a code tree. Our method supports diverse and higher-quality generation; novel user controls while specifying design intent; and autocompleting a partial CAD model under construction.

## Requirements

### Environment
- Linux
- Python 3.8
- CUDA >= 11.4
- GPU with 24 GB ram recommended

### Dependencies
- PyTorch >= 1.10
- Install pythonocc following the instruction [here](https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core).
- Install other dependencies with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

We also provide the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/samxuxiang/skexgen). Note: only tested on CUDA 11.4. 


## Dataset 
We use the dataset from [DeepCAD](https://github.com/ChrisWu1997/DeepCAD) for training and evaluation.

The sketch-and-extrude sequences need to be converted to our obj format following the steps from [SkexGen](https://github.com/samxuxiang/SkexGen). 

You can run the following script to download our post-processed raw data 

    python scripts/download.py


After the raw data is downloaded, run this script to get the Solid, Profile, Loop and full CAD Model data

    sh scripts/process.sh


Run the deduplication script, this will output post-filtered data as ```train_deduplicate.pkl```

    sh scripts/deduplicate.sh



## Usage
First, train the three-level codebook with

    sh scripts/codebook.sh

After the models are trained, extract the neural codes corresponding to each data with

    sh scripts/extract_code.sh



Train the full model (controllable generation)
```bash
sh scripts/gen.sh
```
